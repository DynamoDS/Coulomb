*Instrumentation* is the technology that the Dynamo team uses to understand at scale how visual programmers (who have opted-in) work, how they use Dynamo, and what could be better. This handbook describes how it works from a technical perspective, how to understand existing queries and how to write new ones.

There are a number of different routes through the handbook depending on your interests.

**Route 1: I want to ask a new question**:
 - Check if there's [already a query for it](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/05-appendix/01-list-of-existing-queries/)
 - Start with [using existing summary data](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/04-writing-a-new-query/01-existing-features/)
 - If you find that existing summaries aren't enough, [extract a new feature](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/04-writing-a-new-query/01-existing-features/)
 - If you find that Dynamo isn't measuring what you need, [go here to think about how to add one](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/04-writing-a-new-query/03-new-measurements/)


**Route 2: I want to understand how instrumentation works**:
  - Read the [Architecture Summary](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/02-summary-of-instrumentation-architecture/)
  - Follow the [Anatomy of a query](http://dynamods.github.io/Coulomb/03-anatomy-of-a-query/)
