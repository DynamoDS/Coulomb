title: Summary of instrumentation architecture
---

The technical design of the instrumentation system is made up of multiple components:
* an instrumentation client which observes behaviour on the usersâ€™ computer
* a front-end microservice that records the information
* a back-end microservice that processes the data into a form that is easier to analyse
* an analysis back-end that allows analysis of the data to answer user experience questions.

The overall pipeline is shown in the figure below:
